    <div id="style1"><p>In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m) high,[6] which accords with the official UK government's definition that a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 2,000 feet (610 m) or higher.[7] In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, such as that the mountain rises 300 metres (984 ft) above the surrounding terrain.[1] At one time the U.S. Board on Geographic Names defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (305 m) or taller,[8] but has abandoned the definition since the 1970s. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill.
