    <p style="font-family:Arial">When I first arrived at Neptune, I was not surprised to see that it was all blue. 
        I guess that anybody should have expected this, due to the blue color of the planet. Today we got unpacked. 
        I was, however, surprised to find out that there was US power outlets there. I learned of some new words, too. 
        I have written them below.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:Arial">1. Nepaneese (thats the native language that Neptunians speak.) 
        2. Nepweek (thats one whole week on Neptune) 
        3. Neptunian (a resident of the planet Neptune)

    <p style="font-family:Arial">While I was visiting Neptune, I took many beautiful photographs. I have placed them in my Journal, alongside
        the rest of the paragraphs. I hope someday to visit many other planets.
