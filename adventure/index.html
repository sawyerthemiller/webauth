    <p style="font-family:Arial">When I first arrived at Neptune, I was not surprised to see that it was all blue. 
        I guess that anybody should have expected this, due to the blue color of the planet. Today we got unpacked. 
        I was, however, <em>surprised</em> to find out that there was US power outlets there. I learned of some new words, too. 
        I have written them below.

    <p style="font-family:Arial">While I was visiting Neptune, I took many beautiful photographs. I have placed them in my Journal, alongside
        the rest of the paragraphs. I hope <small>someday</small> to visit many other planets.
